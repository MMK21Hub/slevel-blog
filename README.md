# Slevel blog source code

This repository contains the source code for my personal blog at **[ðŸ“– blog.slevel.xyz](https://blog.slevel.xyz)**.

It uses Jekyll with the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.

## Development instructions

```bash
# Using sudo here is really stupid,
# but Bundler seems to insist on writing to root-owned directories
sudo bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
