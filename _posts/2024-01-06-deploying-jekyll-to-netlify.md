So, it looks like this is my first post in this blog. Let's start off with a brief mention of a problem I encountered while trying to set it up.

## Ruby versions on my PC

Jekyll uses the Ruby programming language, and like many similar interpreted languages (e.g. Python, Go, Node.js), it's important to get the right language version installed before software built on it will work.

The Jekyll documentation says that Ruby versions 2.5.0 and above are supported, but when I tried using the latest Ruby version provided by my OS (2.7.0) to install Jekyll, the `gem` program complained that a dependency required at least Ruby 3.0.0.

To resolve this, I manually installed the latest published version of Ruby (3.3.0 as of January 2024) with [the `ruby-install` tool](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install), and fortunately Jekyll was able to successfully install with the updated Ruby environment.

## Ruby versions on Netlify

For better or for worse, my ordeal with Ruby versions didn't end with getting my local development environment working. The time came to deploy my site to Netlify (an amazing free static web host), which seems to default to an old version of Ruby (2.7.2, to be specific), meaning that I was once again shown an error message. Fortunately, it was the "good" kind of error message, which clearly states what's wrong and points you towards a solution (updating Ruby, in this case). Conveniently, Netlify's docs [detail how to set a specific Ruby version](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#ruby) using an environment variable or a `.ruby-version` file. One gotcha was that despite claiming to support [RVM](https://github.com/rvm/rvm)'s version specifier syntax, Netlify was only able to fetch Ruby if I'd specified an exact version number: `3.3.0` worked, but `3.3` didn't.

However, after I'd told Netlify to use the latest Ruby version (3.3.0), I encountered another error that hadn't happened in my local environment, while `gem` was trying to install dependencies:

```none
11:32:41 AM: An error occurred while installing google-protobuf (3.25.1), and Bundler cannot
11:32:41 AM: continue.
11:32:41 AM: In Gemfile:

11:32:41 AM:       jekyll was resolved to 4.3.3, which depends on
11:32:41 AM:         jekyll-sass-converter was resolved to 3.0.0, which depends on
11:32:41 AM:           sass-embedded was resolved to 1.69.7, which depends on
11:32:41 AM:             google-protobuf
11:32:41 AM: Error during gem install
11:32:41 AM: Failing build: Failed to install dependencies
```

The workaround that I found for this issue was to once again change the Ruby version that Netlify uses &ndash; I chose to do this by setting the `RUBY_VERSION` environment variable in my site settings.

I chose to set it to `3.0.0`, i.e. the earliest version that would avoid the issue from earlier. And this worked! The blog is now live, and assuming that I haven't changed it since this post, the site you're on right now is powered by Ruby 3.0.0.
